# Bash (Unix shell)

_Bash is a Unix shell and command language written by Brian Fox for the GNU Project as a free software replacement for the Bourne shell. First released in 1989, it has been used as the default login shell for most Linux distributions. Bash was one of the first programs Linus Torvalds ported to Linux, alongside GCC._

### What is Bash?

BASH is an acronym for Bourne Again Shell, a punning name, which is a tribute to Bourne Shell (i.e., invented by Steven Bourne).

Bash is a shell program written by Brian Fox as an upgraded version of Bourne Shell program 'sh'. It is an open source GNU project. It was released in 1989 as one of the most popular shell distribution of GNU/Linux operating systems. It provides functional improvements over Bourne Shell for both programming and interactive uses. It includes command line editing, key bindings, command history with unlimited size, etc.

In basic terms, Bash is a command line interpreter that typically runs in a text window where user can interpret commands to carry out various actions. The combination of these commands as a series within a file is known as a Shell Script. Bash can read and execute the commands from a Shell Script.

Bash is the default login shell for most Linux distributions and Apple's mac OS. It is also accessible for Windows 10 with a version and default user shell in Solaris 11.

### Features of Bash
- Bash is sh-compatible as it derived from the original UNIX Bourne Shell. It is incorporated with the best and useful features of the Korn and C shell like directory manipulation, job control, aliases, etc.
- Bash can be invoked by single-character command line options (-a, -b, -c, -i, -l, -r, etc. ) as well as by multi-character command line options also like --debugger, --help, --login, etc.
- Bash Start-up files are the scripts that Bash reads and executes when it starts. Each file has its specific use, and the collection of these files is used to help create an environment.
- Bash consists of Key bindings by which one can set up customized editing key sequences.
- Bash contains one-dimensional arrays using which you can easily reference and manipulate the lists of data.
- Bash comprised of Control Structures like the select construct that specially used for menu generation.
- Directory Stack in Bash specifies the history of recently-visited directories within a list. Example: pushd builtin is used to add the directory to the stack, popd is to remove directory from the stack and dirs builtin is to display content of the directory stack.
- Bash also comprised of restricted mode for the environment security. A shell gets restricted if bash starts with name rbash, or the bash --restricted, or bash -r option passed at invocation.
